V Comments in a new module - Dani

V Arrays in sensors - Dito -- DONE!!
    Instead of hardcoded "lightSensor1, lightSensor2, ...", have an array indexed by position in Sensors.py and Actuators.py    

- Tune steps for turning 90ยบ

    ONCE THE TORTOISE IS COMPLETELY BUILT AND WITHOUT WIRES
    Tune number of steps in turnOnTheSpot (tortoise.py) so that tortoise turns 90ยบ

- Improve random motion

    ONCE THE TORTOISE IS COMPLETELY BUILT AND WITHOUT WIRES
    Wise combination to moveForwards, moveBackwards, and turn so that it goes smoothly and natural.

- Improve comments and clean code

    Dito: sensors.py and actuators.py
    Dani: tortoise.py
    
    Investigate Epydoc - Karam
    
V debug proximity sensor : Mike (NOW!)

V test new eStop - Dito --- DONE!!!

- CHECK CONVENTION FOR NAMES "toTo" or "to_to"

- IMPORTANT: remove "return" in getSensorData, light

- TRY and CATCH lowlevel messages and say "Tortoise is broken. Please return it to BRL for help."

    Investigate exceptions from GPIO library - Mike

    Remove raising exceptions in lowlevel
    Try and catch THE EXCEPTION THAT THE GPIO LIBRARY RAISES in every function inside tortoise.py, and then print the message because it's a hardware problem (the exception comes from the GPIO library)
