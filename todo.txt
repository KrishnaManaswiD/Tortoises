- Improve random motion
- Improve turns
- Improve comments and clean code
V Check pos of error checking with final number of sensors/actuators
- User defined way to turn on LEDs (create enum to redifine position of LEDs to colours)
- Improve sensors.py to arrays
- change self.A to motorLeft
V run motors in parallel
- debug proximity sensor
- change emergencySwitch to eStop
V add moveForward functions
- Add installation of gedit and timeUpdate to setup.sh

- IMPORTANT: remove "return" in getSensorData, light


WITH THE ACTIVITIES TEAM:

    - Function names

    - Convection for movement
    
        Consider other inputs to move functions (time, fraction of wheel...)

    - Error messages

        Set a flag for HINT mode? 
        
        How much hint should be printed ("check second argument", "check number of steps", "I can't travel back in time"...)
        
        Colours and random greetings

    - How to blink LEDs (in parallel?, which ones?, ...)

        Blink LEDs for feedback: red ones for errors, blue one for switched on, green ones for switches...

        LEDs in a thread?
