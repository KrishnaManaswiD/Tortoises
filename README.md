In this branch, I am trying to develop an easier method to connect to the robots and program them.  

At the moment, the robots are used like a raspberry pi. They are hooked up to a screen, keyboard and mouse. This make it hard to take them to events.
The new method being explored is to use a single cable to connect to the robots from a laptop and program them through a web based interface. 
In practise, this means that schools do not have to install software or unplug their existing setups.
They also dont have to install additional software and can connect to the robots through the browser.
