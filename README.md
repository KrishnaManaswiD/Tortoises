# Tortoises
This is an alternative repository for the Tortoise robots designed by the FARSCOPE 2015 group from Bristol.
The original repository is private to the Bristol Robotics Lab. I will be maintaining and updating this public repository henceforth.

A few changes to note:
The original version had separate brances for python 2 and 3. This repository is going to use python 3 only.

History:  
The Tortoise robots were designed for public outreach by the FARSCOPE 2015 students. They were made in 2015-16.
They are meant to be used in schools and outreach activities to encourage computer programming and spark interest in robotics.
The brains is a Raspberry Pi with an add on board that interfaces with motors and sensors. The body was designed to be lasercut and take a bit of beating from kids. 
Most of the sensors and buttons can be moved around. This results in interesting new behaviours without changing the code.

After first being tried out at Abeywood school in Filton, they have been used at other venues such as @Bristol.
The name is inspired by William Grey Walter's robots that he built in Bristol the late 1940s, which are some of the first autonomous robots.
