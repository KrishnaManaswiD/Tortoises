- Allow at low_level to have less sensors/actuators

- Improve comments and clean code

    Dito: sensors.py and actuators.py
    Dani: tortoise.py
    
    Investigate Epydoc - Karam
    
- IMPORTANT: remove "return" in getSensorData, light

- TRY and CATCH lowlevel messages and say "Tortoise is broken. Please return it to BRL for help."

    Investigate exceptions from GPIO library - Mike

    Remove raising exceptions in lowlevel
    Try and catch THE EXCEPTION THAT THE GPIO LIBRARY RAISES in every function inside tortoise.py, and then print the message because it's a hardware problem (the exception comes from the GPIO library)

- Create python package
